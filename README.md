URL Saver For Chrome!

Chrome extension I created using JavaScript, HTML/CSS, and chrome.tabs api.

There are three functionailities on this chrome extension
  1. Save Input: Saves the link that the user manually typed into the input bar
  2. Save Tab: Saves the URL of the current active tab the user is on
  3. Delete All: Delete all the links that were saved
