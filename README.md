Chrome Tab Bookmark Extension!

Chrome extension I created using JavaScript, HTML/CSS, and chrome.tabs api.

There are three functionalities on this chrome extension:
  1. Add URL: Adds the URL that the user manually typed into the input bar.
  2. Add Tab: Adds the URL of the current active tab the user is on.
  3. Delete All: Deletes all the saved URLs.
